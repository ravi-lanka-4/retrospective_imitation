Installation description using CMake
************************************

The easiest way to install SCIP is to use the SCIP Optimization Suite which
contains SCIP, SoPlex, and ZIMPL. For that we refer to the INSTALL file of
the SCIP Optimization Suite (In case of the SCIP Optimization Suite, there is
no need to specify any directories, the compiling process is fully
automated).

Compiling SCIP directly can be done as follows:

1) unpack the tarball "tar xvzf scip-x.y.z.tgz"
2) change into the directory "cd scip-x.y.z"
3) create a new directory "build"
4) configure the build "cmake .."
5) start compiling SCIP "make"
6) (recommended) check your SCIP installation "make check" or "ctest -R -default"
7) (optional) install the header, libraries, and binary, e.g.,
   "DESTDIR=<custom/install/path> make install"

CMake checks for available third-party libraries like GMP or ZLIB and sets up
the configuration accordingly.

There are multiple options to customize the configuration. You can list them
using "cmake .. -LH" and set them by running "cmake .. -D<option>=<value>".
Options can be chained together or be specified in subsequent calls
to cmake. The existing configuration will be updated or extended.

To specify a custom path to a library you may specify "-D<name>_DIR=<path>",
e.g., "cmake .. -DSOPLEX_DIR=<path/to/SoPlex/build/or/install>".

Refer to the online documentation and the FAQ section for further information.


Windows instructions
********************

To build SCIP on Windows you may use the CMake GUI to specify the path to SCIP
and the desired location for the build. Available options are listed and can
be modified to suit your needs. After the configuration step is done, open
the generated Visual Studio solution file and compile it.

Alternatively you may use the command line to build SCIP in an already-generated
configuration directory: "cmake --build <path>"
