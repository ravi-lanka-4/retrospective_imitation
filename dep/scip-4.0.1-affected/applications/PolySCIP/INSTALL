PolySCIP is equipped with a Makefile located in the PolySCIP
directory. Change on the command line into the PolySCIP directory and
execute 'make'

In case of compilation problems, try torun 'make' with the same command
line options that were used for the compilation of  SCIP.

in the PolySCIP directory

After a successful build, the executable will be located in the
directory 'bin/'
