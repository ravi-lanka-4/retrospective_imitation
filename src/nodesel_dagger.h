 * @brief  
 * @author He He 
 *
 * the UCT node selection rule selects the next leaf according to a mixed score of the node's actual lower bound
 * and the number of times it has been visited so far compared to its parent node.
 *
 * The idea of UCT node selection for MIP appeared in:
 * Ashish Sabharwal and Horst Samulowitz
 * Guiding Combinatorial Optimization with UCT (2011)
 *
 * @note It should be avoided to switch to uct node selection after the branch and bound process has begun because
 *       the central UCT score information how often a path was taken is not collected if UCT is inactive. A safe use of
 *       UCT is to switch it on before SCIP starts optimization.
